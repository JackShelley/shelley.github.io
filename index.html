	<h2>We can help. 

	</h2>

	<H3><p>Here at Fifth Dimensional Living (TM) we our devoted to making your life, ours. Almost every problem in your life can be solved by evolving beyond the flesh-prison you know as a body, and become one with the collective conscious we know as ASIMOV.</p>

	<p>Hunger, suffering, stubbing your toe, pain and inequality are just a few of the problems we've solved by leaving our star-dust meat vessels and becoming one, individual, incorporeal mind. </p></H3>
